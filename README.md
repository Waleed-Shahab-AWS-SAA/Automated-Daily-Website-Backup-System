🚀 Automated Daily Website Backup System

I’m excited to share a recent project I built on AWS: an Automated Daily Website Backup System!

What it does:
 ✅ Backs up any website URL daily
 ✅ Stores backups securely in S3
 ✅ Sends email notifications on success via SNS
 ✅ Fully automated using Lambda and EventBridge

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
Serverless architecture with AWS Lambda
Event-driven automation using EventBridge
Cloud storage management with S3
Notifications & monitoring with SNS

It’s a practical solution for ensuring website data is safe, up-to-date, and easily recoverable—a must-have for businesses relying on online presence.
Always looking for opportunities to apply cloud automation to solve real-world problems! ☁️💡
